# YOLO-HiVis

YOLO-HiVis is a computer vision project that utilizes a custom trained YOLO model to detect and classify high-visibility vests and people in images or video streams.

## Features

- Detection and classification of high-visibility vests & people in images or video streams.
- Algorithms for calculating intersection over union (IoU) and determining bounding box overlaps.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
